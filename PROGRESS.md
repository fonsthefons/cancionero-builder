# Progress

## 2026-10-12 — Decisions (asked before starting)

- **Code lives only in the builder.** A book repo holds `songs/`, `book.yaml`
  (+ optional `tags.yaml`, `author_aliases.yaml`, `title_fixes.yaml`), the built
  `index.html`, `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, icons, a README. Commands run
  from the builder and point at a book.
- **New books** go in `~/Documents/<name>`, each its own GitHub repo with Pages.
- **Tags** are free in song files; an optional `tags.yaml` gives labels and order.
  The build reports tags not in `tags.yaml` instead of failing.
- **Features**: the union of cancionero, cancionero-hakuna and cancionero-pagano,
  with per-book switches in `book.yaml`.
- **PDF import**: one generic importer for text PDFs, with a review list of
  doubtful songs.
- **Proof**: rebuild copies of the 3 existing books in `scratch/` and compare
  with their current `index.html`. The source repos stay untouched.
- **GitHub tonight**: no book repos (create-a-book is tested in dry-run). The
  builder itself goes to a private GitHub repo.

## Plan

1. git init, `.gitignore`, `.venv/`, requirements.
2. Merge the code: `builder/` (build), `importer/` (add songs), `web/` (page),
   taking the newest version of each file and adding switches where the books differ.
3. Book config (`book.yaml`) + free tags.
4. CLI `cancionero.py`: `new`, `build`, `add`, `add-list`, `add-pdf`, `links`, `tags`.
5. `new`: create the folder, files, git init, GitHub repo + Pages (`--dry-run`).
6. PDF importer.
7. Tests: rebuild the 3 books from copies and compare; browser checks of the page.
8. README.
